>S.u.S.E. Linux: Besides the gcc compiler and libc libraries, which are both from the &quot;d&quot; series, other packages  need to be installed or the build will fail. If compiling for svgalib, the svgalib package from series &quot;d&quot; installed. If compiling for the X-Window System, you must have xdevel package from series &quot;x&quot; installed. These packages can be installed using the &quot;yast&quot; utility included in the S.u.S.E. distribution.

>Compile with the `c89' compiler. Though `gcc' has no problems  with compiling and optimizing xmame/xmess, the resulting `c89'  executable is faster on an empty machine (read: xmame can use all  cpu &amp; memory without competing with other high priority  processes), so you can set `frameskip' to 1.

><P
>You must use the OpenStep gnumake, not make. You must also use the NeXT/Apple cc rather than gcc. Also use only the optimisation options as recommended for OpenStep in the makefile, others will cause the resulting executable to crash. The OpenStep assembler on i386 architectures is incompatible with the mame assembler CPU cores and thus you must use the C versions (Use i386-noasm instead of i386 when compiling for i386).
    </P
><P
>The supplied complier is based on gcc 2.7.2.1 which will not compile src/profiler.c without crashing. To get around this you must turn off + optimisation when this crash occurs, re-make to compile this file only, then stop the make, re-enable optimisation, and continue.
    </P
><P
>On an OpenStep keyboard the functions keys do not all operate as expected. Using the command key in conjuction with a number key generates the equivalent function key within xmame, with 0, - and = + representing F10, F11 and F12 resepectively. Also note that the ALT + keys cannot be mapped. As most games tend to use this as the default fire button it is exteremly useful to remap this globally the first time you run xmame.
