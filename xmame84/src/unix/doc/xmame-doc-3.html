>What is mame?</H2
><P
>MAME is an arcade machine emulator. Started in 1997 by Nicola  Salmoria, mame started out as a series of emulators for  individual games. This series of emulators was combined into a  simgle multi-game emulator. This is the current form of mame; no longer a one-man show, there are over 100 contributors to the project.
   </P
><P
>MAME was created by Nicola Salmoria.

>What is xmame/xmess?</H2
><P
>Xmame/xmess are the Unix/X11 ports of the mame and mess projects. It makes mame/mess available on *ix machines using the X11R6 X-Window System (and SVGAlib/ggi/XF86-DGA/OpenGL/SDL too).
   </P
><P
>MAME was orginally ported by Allard Van Der Bas, Dick the Ridder, Juan Antonio Martinez, and Hans de Goede.
   </P
><P
>Xmame/xmess is currently maintained by Lawrence Gold.

>What are the differences between mame/mess and xmame/xmess?</H2
><P
>None significant.
   </P
><P
>Xmame/xmess is based on the mame/mess source code. Due to technical reasons beyond the scope of this document, the mame/mess source may not compile under Unix. That's why the xmame/xmess project exists. Each time mame/mess is updated, the code is tested  (and patched if needed) under Unix. This way xmame/xmess releases are always the same as their mame counterparts.
   </P
><P
>There are no plans for the independent development of xmame/xmess.

><P
>Another reason for xmamerc/xmessrc is keyboard remapping. Some Unix  keyboards are very different than their PC counterparts. To  compensate for the changes, xmame/xmess allows you to remap keys that  are not available on Unix keyboards to keys that are available.

   </P
><P
>This value should be ok for everyone, but if you still have problems, read on.

>If, however, you make the buffersize too large, then so much audio becomes buffered, that the sound could become lagged. E.g., you would hear the coin drop sound 0.5 seconds after pressing the insert coin key. In this case, lower the bufsize to, for example, 1.5.

Don't forget your X11 config file might have a number of different &quot;Screen&quot; sections in it, and you will need to add Modes to the one that is actually active with your Xserver is running. And of course it's not always that easy, since you also need to tell X which monitor settings are required for these resolution modes. This is done through Modeline entries in the &quot;Monitor&quot; section of your X config file.

>I've got a dual processor machine. What can I do to take full advantage of this?</H2
><P
>Not much. Xmame is a single-threaded port of a single-threaded DOS app. Some degree of speedup will hopefully be found on an SMP machine since xmame is more likely to get to hog its one CPU for longer. But of course the same applies to any CPU-intensive program. And all the things one would normally do to any application to give it more CPU time (higher priority, kill or renice unecessary process, etc.) will work with xmame.
   </P
><P
>Now you may at this point be thinking, &ldquo;Surely you could have one thread doing emulation and another thead doing graphics to get a speedup.&rdquo; Yes, but there are some serious issues to consider. The first is synchronisation between the threads, which needs to be pretty tight. If not done smoothly. the overhead will blow most of the benefit away. Also, it needs to be implemented with a portable threads interface ... which basically means POSIX threads. In a nutshell, it's a lot of effort for probably not much gain. But of course if you are feeling particulary energetic and in the mood to code, then patches can always be submitted to the xmame devel mailing list ... :)

Unfortunately, a lot of Linux distributions have an old version of zlib installed as /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a, and the new version installed as /usr/lib/libz.a. If this is the case, it's harmless to remove /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a. If you're not sure whether this is the case, just move /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a to another location.

In the case of SDL, the window will be in the resolution of closest matching resolution that SDL can switch to for full screen display.
   </P
><P
>In this case, you have to add &quot;Modelines&quot; for these resolutions in your XF86config file and add these resolutions to the resolutions list of your display somewhere in your XF86config file (you know, the list of resolutions you can switch to using ctrl-+).
   </P

>If you don't want to alter your XF86config file, another solution is to run xmame.x11 with the &quot;-scale 2&quot; argument. In this case, the emulator will use 640x480 instead of 320x240, 800x600 instead of 400x300, etc. But I don't recommend it. The scaling uses cpu and the games will run more slowly.

To know if your game is still supported, try 'xmame.x11 -list gamename'. If you do not pass a game name, the complete list of supported games is printed, and you can search for the new game name (better use 'xmame.x11 -listfull').

>If the name hasn't changed, check to see if you have the correct romdump. Run 'xmame.x11 -verifyroms gamename' to check your romset. If this fails you will need to download a newer romdump. Also check your parent roms as a possible cause of this romset failure.
