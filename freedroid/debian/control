Description: A clone of Paradroid - a strategic shoot-em up
 You must clear a spaceship from all droids.  To achieve this your
 device will need to take control of more powerful droids, more able
 to confront the most powerful ones.  But you'll also need to manage
 your energy, as you won't be able to control any droid for an
 indefinite time, and even your own device has a limited lifetime.
