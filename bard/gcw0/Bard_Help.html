<h1>Help for Bard on GCW-Zero</h1>
<br>
<p>Bard Storyteller is a text reader.  Bard not only allows a user to read books, but also can read books to the user using text-to-speech.
</p>

</p>
<p>Bard can read txt, html and epub files.
</p>
<p>Bard saves its context in a configuration file ($HOME/.bard_config) across sessions, remembering the files you are reading, the position you are at, and which voice you selected.
</p>
<p>You can select a file to read from the File menu, press <strong>SELECT</strong> then use the d-pad to move to the File selection menu, press <strong>A</strong> to select the menu, then again use the d-pad and <strong>A</strong> to select a File/Directory to navigate to the File in your file systems.  It will remember that directory for future File selections.
</p>
<p>You can select a voice from the voice menu, press <strong>SELECT</strong> then use the d-pad to move to the voice selection menu, which is likely on the second page, press <strong>A</strong> to select the menu, then again use the d-pad and <strong>A</strong> to select a voice. <strong>X</strong> will start speaking.  The current spoken word is highlighted.
</p>
<p>Bard uses CMU's Flite Speech Synthesizer System to render the text as speech.  Three core voices are included: slt (US female), rms (US male) and awb.  The default voice, kal, using an older technology, is also available.
