We have kept the core code to BSD-like copyright, thus the system is
free to use in commercial products, with commercial extensions.  (L)GPL
code is only utilized as part of the build process or linked in at run-time
(SDL libraries) and does not taint any of the core code.  

As a collection it is distributed under the following license.  Note
a few files in this distribution have a different but equally free
non-conflicting licence, see below.

All files within this distribution have the above license except
the following

config.sub
config.guess
missing
install-sh
mkinstalldirs
   Copyright FSF, and under the GPL, these files are only used for
   convenient configuration and are not part of the generated binary,
   and therefore do not impose any GPL restrictions on the rest of the
   system.  But as they are standard methods for configuration they 
   are included.

pandora/PXML.xml
pandora/bard.sh
   These were autogenerated by the Open Pandora scripts genpxml.sh and
   pnd_make.sh, but edited to be appropriate for the Bard.pnd file.

Some of the files are directly copied from CMU Flite (which is
distributed under the same CMU license and same copyright holder
(CMU), but may have copyright dates starting before the existence of
BARD 0.0).
