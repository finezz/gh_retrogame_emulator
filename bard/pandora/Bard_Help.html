<p>Bard can read txt, html and epub files.
</p>
<p>Bard saves its context in a configuration file ($HOME/.bard_config)
across sessions, remembering the files you are reading, the
position you are at, and which voice you selected.
</p>
<p>You can select a voice from the voice menu, press SELECT (or m) then
use the d-pad to move to the voice selection menu, press B (or ENTER)
to select then menu, then again use the d-pad and B to select a voice.
X (or s) will start speaking.  The current spoken word is highlighted.
</p>
<p>Bard uses CMU's Flite Speech Synthesizer System to render the text
as speech.  Three core voices are included: slt (US female), rms (US
male) and awb.  The default voice, kal, using an older technology, is
also available.

<p>The Pandora port of Bard, and the significant updates made, were
encouraged by the Alive and Kicking Coding Competition 2013/2014.
