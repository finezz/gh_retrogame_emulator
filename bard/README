Bard Storyteller 0.10 July 2014
http://festvox.org/bard/

Bard Storyteller is a text reader.  Bard not only allows a user to
read books, but can also read books to the user using text-to-speech.
It supports txt, epub and (x)html files.

Bard Storyteller is free software, distributed under a BSD-like license.

Bard depends on CMU Flite (cmuflite.org) for both some general C
utilities and for synthesis itself.  Bard is targeted at small
portable devices such as smart phones, not so smart phones and offline
devices, but also works on laptops and desktops.  The original target
platform was the open hardware Ben Nanonote from sharism.cc
(http://en.qi-hardware.com/wiki/Ben_NanoNote).  

In addition to source code support for standard Linux and Windows
support, binary distributions are available for Ben Nanonote, Open
Pandora and GCW Zero.

Bard uses libSDL (http://www.libsdl.org -- 1.2) to provide graphics, sound
and input, thus aiming at multiple platforms.  Bard is written in C.

Bard was written by Alan W Black (awb@cs.cmu.edu) as a better ebook reader
for him to use, and as a tool to improve CMU Flite's speech synthesis API.

Bard was somewhat inspired by various ebook reading apps I've used on
various PDAs and phones.  Most recently, after downloading Lecturer
http://code.google.com/p/lecturer/ by Ulrich Hecht, and adding Flite
support to Lecturer, I saw it might be easy to write a full text
reader myself from scratch, so I did.

I'd like this to be TTS engine neutral but its not.

At present the kal_diphone voice is built in, but any dumped Flite cg 
voice may be specified on command line with 
     -voice file:///home/.../VOICE.flitevox
If initially started with -voices_dir PATH, voices may be loaded
within Bard and remembered for particular files that are being read.  At
present 16KHz (order 25) cg voices are too slow for the Ben Nanonote
but are fine on faster devices (e.g. Open Pandora, Rasberry Pi, GCW
Zero).

It can be run fully from the graphical page, using game console keys only, 
but also can use a standard keyboard.  There isn't yet support for devices
with no keyboard or game console buttons.

DEPENDENCIES

flite-1.9.0 (at least, you want to update from the CVS tree)
   a version that works with this version of bard is available in
   http://festvox.org/bard/   
libSDL 1.2
libSDL_ttf 2.0
   Both are available from  http://www.libsdl.org
For epub (which is optional)
   you need 
       libzip http://www.nih.at/libzip/
   Note we need both zip.h and zipconf.h installed before configure will
   enable epub support. 
For epub images you also need
libSDL_image
libSDL_gfx

COMPILATION

tar jxvf flite-1.9-current.tar.bz2
cd flite-1.9-current
./configure && make && make voices
export FLITEDIR=`pwd`

tar jxvf bard-0.10.0-release.tar.bz2
cd bard-0.10-release
./configure
make
./bin/bard -voices_dir $FLITEDIR/voices

Bard requires access to a .ttf font, at configuration time it tries to find 
this in /usr/share/fonts, but it might not succeed in finding the right one.
You can edit config/config and add a (full) pathname to a .ttf font.
For development I used LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf (you probably want a serif
font).  You can get the Liberation fonts from
   https://www.redhat.com/promo/fonts/
Or DejaVu fonts from
   http://dejavu-fonts.org
If it can't automatically find one, you can specify a full path name to one

./bin/bard -font /usr/share/fonts/liberation/LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf

And it will remember that for future calls (it saves the font pathname in 
$HOME/.bard_config on exit)

A config file is created in $HOME/.bard_config.  You might need to
remove that if things fail to work out properly.  This stores
customized colors, fonts and also what your current file (and
position) is and up to 20 recent files and positions.  I am trying to
make that robust over version upgrades, and have succeeded so far.

BASIC COMMANDS ARE

tab    Toggle speech mode
space  Toggle scrolling
f      display file selection window
       arrow keys, home, page down, and enter for selection
g      display general parameters (macro navigation, volume, speed)
h      display help
r      recent files
m      menu (of other pages)
v      voice select
i      Increase font/volume up/increase scroll speed
o      Decrease font/volume down/decrease scroll speed
vol up/down (F11/F12) control scroll speed, volume or page up/down

You can navigate a page with pagedown, home and cursor keys within a
page.  Page up is harder than I thought, it does something useful, but
may be not always exactly what you want.

The general parameters page ('g') displays file name, position, speech
volume, speed, battery status (if supported), and current time.  If
you use the arrow keys to position over "<<<" and ">>>", pressing
enter will modify the values.  Currently the battery status on the
my Nanonote is found by running a script called "battery" and taking $2
field in the result.  (This works for my battery script but probably
not yours).  You can make it run your battery script by specifying it
on the command line with -battery_script SCRIPT (or editing the
.bard_config file).

The volume keys on the Ben Nanonote (F11 F12) provide control for 
scroll speed, volume or page up/down depending the current state
(scrolling, speaking or nothing, respectively)

This version doesn't support a mouse (or touch screen) but later versions
will (as well as whatever buttons you have on your mobile device).

COLORS

You can customize your own colors by specify them in the form of 0xFFFFFF
in the ~/.bard_config file.  It is best to run bard and quit it to get a 
basic file then change the various color specifications to what you want.
There are only a very few builtin (black. white, red, blue and green), but
you can specify and red green blue hex values.  e.g. if you want the main
text window background color to be antiquewhite change the line

-text_background_color "white"

to

-text_background_color "0xcdc0b0"

AKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to LM for giving a whole set of fixes, and getting me to add some
new features

The Bard port to OpenPandora was encouraged by the Alive and Kicking
Coding Competition 2013/2014.

FUTURE GOALS

We want this to be a platform for new (fast) high quality synthesis
voices in Flite and are working on getting them fast enough to be
practical on 336MHz processors.  We also want to support more ebook
formats.  Specific features already on the list are:

Other ebook formats: prc, rtf, pdf
More complete support for epub, (x)html
Search
Chapter Navigation (when chapters can be found in epub files)
Support for more platforms (e.g. Android)
Support for non-Latin writing scripts (through pango)
(Cleaner) Support for cross compilation
SDL 2 support

But please recommend other features you'd like to see.
