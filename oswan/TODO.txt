- Improve the code : it's a mess. (seriously)
- Proper 32-bits support
On Linux, if the bpp is different from the display, it will be converted but there will be a significant drop in speed.
The only problem is the palette : it is not properly converted to 32 bits...
Look at emu/WSRender.c and SetPalette function for more info.

- Improve resolution support on computers
- Improve input code
