# TODO List
**(see also Github's issue tracker)**

 - 'make all' : the -j option gets discarded sometimes in the way (yeah, I own a quad core server and I want compilation to be fast :) ) -zorun

 - Refactor all of the user interaction (displaying menus, etc). Could use some curses wrapper (although many of them seem abandonned). Also, wtf, curses has a structure called a *window*, that makes things easier (no need to always stay in the main stdscr) -zorun

 - Be able to configure keyboard (to play with ZQSD in France, for instance) -zorun

 - Rework the very first levels (it is confusing to have the portal gun while not being able to use it) -zorun
