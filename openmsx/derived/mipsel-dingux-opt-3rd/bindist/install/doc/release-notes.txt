Release Notes for openMSX 0.9.1 (2012-09-30)
============================================

This release mostly fixes a bug in dir-as-disk that was introduced in openMSX
0.9.0, when adding support for the DMK format and low level disk emulation. We
not only fixed that bug, we rewrote dir-as-disk almost completely, making it a
lot more robust.

Here's the list with all highlights:

MSX device support:
- Accuracy improvements:
  - improved some details on the laserdisc emulation
  - improved timing of the VDP LINE command (thanks to NYYRIKKI for the ideas)
- added Toshiba HX-21, Toshiba HX-22 and Toshiba HX-22I. The latter two have a
  switchable RS-232C interface (use the new toshiba_rs232c_switch setting)

New or improved emulator features:
- fixed crash with fast resampler and 8192 samples
- dir-As-Disk:
  - dir-as-disk works properly again and is now a lot more robust
  - improve error reporting when something goes wrong
- console support/scripts:
  - added script to save current screen to file in MSX loadable format, thanks
    to NYYRIKKI
- performance improvements:
  - improved console rendering speed (uses less CPU)
  - improved Tcl integration
  - speed up low level disk emulation
  - optimized rendering of superimposed modes (Video9000, laserdisc)
  - several other performance improvements

Build system, packaging, documentation:
- Added build support for DragonFly BSD, thanks to John Marino

And of course the usual various bug fixes.

In "doc/manual/index.html" you can find a set of HTML manuals for openMSX.
Make sure you read this if you haven't used openMSX before, but also to learn
more about the new and changed features.

CPU and graphics performance varies a lot, depending on the openMSX settings
and the MSX hardware and software you're emulating. Some things run fine on a
200 MHz machine, others are slow on a 2 GHz machine. For performance tuning
tips, see the Setup Guide.

openMSX is confirmed to run on the following operating systems: Linux, Windows,
Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD; on x86, x86-64, PPC, ARM, MIPS and Sparc
CPU's. Running on other operating systems (wherever SDL runs) or CPU's should
be possible, but may require some modifications to the build system. If you are
compiling on a new platform, please share your experiences (see below for
contact info), so we can make openMSX more portable.
