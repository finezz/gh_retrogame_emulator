Important: You need to get sparrow3d first
(git://github.com/theZiz/sparrow3d.git) to compile puzzletube!
Read the sparrow3d Makefile, understand it and compile it with "make".
Or just type "make" and hope, that it works. ;)
After that read the Makefile of puzzletube, understand it and compile it
with "make", too. Again: You can try to compile just with "make" and
may have luck, that you have the same folder-hierachy like me. But the
Makefiles are very easy to read and understand, so give it a try. ;)
