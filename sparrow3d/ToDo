Roadmap til next version (tag):
- File management
	- Searching files
	  - Windows
- Project management
  - Toolbar:
	- New
	- Load
	- Save
	- Save as
	- Make
	- Make Clean
	- Run
	- "Install" Target
	- Target Listbox
  - class for every option
  - class for every target
	- Makefile Options
	- Extrafiles like starters or PXML
  - compiling and copying (!) in subfolders
  - Globale or target specific extra options, that are added to the compilation or linking

general Roadmap:
- third device layer (controlled by sparrowCore)
  - axis are exactly the same
  - as much buttons createable as you want
  - button relation changeable
  - button name from host spGetButtonName
  - button is identifyable by name and id.
    - int spNewButton(char* name) => returns id (faster)
    - spGetButtonByName, spGetButtonByID
    - Returns *int => changeable
- sparrowFont additional or own part, which allows to draw blocked text
  (e.g. text from sparrowText ;-) )
- sparrowText faster Lookup: O(log(n)) instead of O(n)
- Network (with threads)
- GUI

Nice to have:
- cool intro with sparrows
- ponies => rainbow dash would make my engine 20% cooler...
