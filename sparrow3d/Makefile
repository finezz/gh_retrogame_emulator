# Hi and welcome to the "sparrow3d Makefile". This Makefile is for compiling
# sparrow3d on unix based systems or Windows with Mingw32/Cygwin (not tested)

# === First of all some defines. If your compilation is slow or instable, check
# === the defines and changes them for your Target.
# === Every target is in an extra file named like the target + .mk, e.g.
# === gp2x.mk. If you have another path settings than me, just duplicate the
# === target file, alter the paths and call maybe make myGp2x if your file is
# === named myGp2x.mk. So you are independent from my changes of the target
# === files. ;) However always have a look at the changelog, maybe I add new
# === fancy optimization, you have to add in your target file yourself!

# -DDO_USE_NOT_WASD_BUTTONS enables other buttons instead of WASD for the
# action buttons and QE for the shoulder buttons. For debugging and some
# direction based games QWEASD is fine, but for release, ctrl, alt and
# so one are better I think. More details in sparrowDefines.h. Of course
# this defines makes only sense for PC. ;) However, it is a good idea
# to use make OUTSIDE_FLAG=-DDO_USE_NOT_WASD_BUTTONS.

# -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION enables a faster multiplication for fixed point
# arithmetics, it may look ugly on bigger resolution or may be too inaccurate.

# -DFAST_DIVISION does the same as -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION, but for division.

# -DFAST_BUT_UGLY may crash. It uses possibly memory (just reading),
# which it not owns. Try always to have some border pixels to your
# textures if using! However as it says, it makes sparrow3d a bit faster,
# but the texture mapping a bit uglier.

# If you activate -DDO_NOT_USE_DELAY there will be no delay of 1 ms, if
# the time between two calculations is 0. If your device is powerfull
# don't use it. I activate it only for the gp2x.

# === Now some globale variables. These are the default values for compilation on
# === a Linux machine. The other targets then change, where their have
# === differences in the target files (the .mk files)

# DYNAMIC says, which libraries will be linked dynamicly. Most of the time these
# are all used libraries, but some systems also need static linking, too. Because
# as default no library is linked static, STATIC is not defined yet.
DYNAMIC =  -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_ttf -lSDL_image -lSDL -lm
# -lSDL_net

# CFLAGS defines some globale flags for gcc. Even on the gp2x with only 16 KB
# CPU Cache, -O3 is faster than -Os. So most things you don't have to change
CFLAGS = -O2 -fsingle-precision-constant -fPIC

# GENERAL_TWEAKS are some flags for gcc, which should make the compilation
# faster, but some of them are just poinsoness snake oil - they may help a bit,
# but could also kill you. ^^
GENERAL_TWEAKS = -ffast-math $(OUTSIDE_FLAG)

# every device using SMALL_RESOLUTION_DEVICES in the compilation will enable
# the faster multiplication and division
SMALL_RESOLUTION_DEVICES = -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION -DFAST_DIVISION

# The default Compiler is gcc with debug symbols and a X86CPU (that's a define
# for sparrow or your game, not used by gcc.
#CPP = mipsel-linux-gcc -march=native -DX86CPU -g $(GENERAL_TWEAKS)
CPP = mipsel-linux-gcc -g $(GENERAL_TWEAKS)

# SDL sets some SDL options with the program "sdl-config".
SDL = `sdl-config --cflags`

# SPARROW_LIB determines, where the sparrow library is.
SPARROW_LIB = -L.

# SPARROW_INCLUDE determines, where the sparrow includes are
SPARROW_INCLUDE = -I.

# SDL_PATH determines, where the SDL includes are (necessary if SDL is in subfolders)
SDL_PATH = -I/usr/include/SDL

# Uncomment one of this lines to create or use profile files for
# compiling. You can compile with -fprofile-generate for ANY target,
# copy the *.gcda files to the source code folder and recompile
# (complete!) with -fprofile-use again. This uses some in runtime found
# possibilities to improve sparrow3d.
# CFLAGS += -fprofile-generate
# CFLAGS += -fprofile-use

# INCLUDE determines, where all the other includes are
# INCLUDE = -I/usr/include

# LIB determines, where all the other libraries are
# LIB = -L/usr/lib

# This deactivates the perspective mapping and makes the lib smaller,
# but as I tested not faster.
# CFLAGS += -DNO_PERSPECTIVE

# Normaly theese flags are activated only for small and/or slow devices.
# But sometimes it is important to activate them for testing purpose
# even on faster hardware. ;)
# CFLAGS += -DFAST_DIVISION -DFAST_MULTIPLICATION
